All files and folders included are part of Homework(python-API) for Week 6.


## Intro/Objective
The main objective is to find correlations between weather and distance between equtor. This project involves creating data frames using Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals and map the data to build Scatter plots and Linear regression models using Pandas/Jupyter Notebook for data. 

### Methods Used
* Import Python Modules (pandas, matplotlib.pyplot,scipy.stats)

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas
* Jupyter lab
* Matplotlib
* APIs

## Needs of this project
- Data analysis
- Create python scripts
- Pandas libaries
- Matplotlib 
- hvplot
- Jupyter notebook

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Please generate and use API keys from https://openweathermap.org/api and https://apidocs.geoapify.com/
3. Check and make sure output_data folder is available to generate output files
3. Run the files 'WeatherPy.ipynb' and 'VacationPy.ipynb' using Jupyter lab
